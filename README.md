## Getting Started

[TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/) (Formerly LambdaTest) is the world's first full-stack AI Agentic Quality Engineering platform that empowers teams to test intelligently, smarter, and ship faster. Built for scale, it offers a full-stack testing cloud with 10K+ real devices and 3,000+ browsers. With AI-native test management, MCP servers, and agent-based automation, TestMu AI supports Selenium, Appium, Playwright, and all major frameworks.

With TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest), you can upload files to the cloud and use them in your Python UnitTest automation tests. This sample shows how to configure file uploads and reference them inside your test scripts.

- [Sign up on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/register/) (Formerly LambdaTest).
- Follow the [TestMu AI documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/) (Formerly LambdaTest) for the full setup walkthrough.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x and pip
- A TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) account with your username and access key

### Setup

Clone the sample repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/Python-UnitTest-Selenium && cd Python-UnitTest-Selenium
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your credentials as environment variables.

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**Windows:**

```bash
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

### Upload a file

Use the TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) file upload API to upload the file to the cloud:

```
https://api.lambdatest.com/automation/api/v1/user-files
```

### Configure capabilities

In your test file, add the uploaded filename(s) to the `lambda:userFiles` capability:

```python
desired_caps = {
    'LT:Options': {
        "build": "Python Demo",
        "name": "Python Demo Test",
        "platformName": "Windows 11",
        "selenium_version": "4.0.0",
        "lambda:userFiles": ["photo1.png", "photo2.png"]
    },
    "browserName": "Chrome",
    "browserVersion": "98.0",
}
```

### Use the file in your test

Reference the uploaded file by its path on the remote machine.

**Windows:**

```python
elm = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//input[@type='file']")
elm.send_keys("C:\Users\ltuser\Downloads\photo1.png")
```

**macOS:**

```python
elm = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//input[@type='file']")
elm.send_keys("/Users/ltuser/Downloads/photo1.png")
```

### Run tests

```bash
python lambdatest_test.py
```

View results on your TestMu AI dashboard.

## LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

On **January 12, 2026**, [LambdaTest evolved to TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/), the world's first fully autonomous **Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform**.

Same team. Same infrastructure. Same customer accounts. All existing LambdaTest logins, scripts, capabilities, and integrations continue to work without change.

### How LambdaTest Evolved into TestMu AI

In 2017, we launched LambdaTest with a simple mission: make testing fast, reliable, and accessible. As LambdaTest grew, we expanded into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the full depth of the testing lifecycle.

As software development entered the AI era, testing had to evolve, too. We rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up, with autonomous agents that **plan, author, execute, analyze, and optimize tests** while keeping humans in the loop. The platform integrates with your repos, CI, IDEs, and terminals, continuously learning from every code change and development signal.

That evolution earned a new name: **TestMu AI**, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering. TestMu is not a new name for us. It is the name of our annual community conference, which has brought together 100,000+ quality engineers to discuss how AI would reshape testing, long before that became an industry norm.

What started as a high-performance cloud testing platform has transformed into an AI-native, multi-agent system powering a connected, end-to-end quality layer. That evolution defined a new identity: LambdaTest evolved into TestMu AI, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering.
